Characteristics of Set (Data Structure)
---------------------------------------
-- IMPORTANT --
By default set-variable wants to organize the float/integer elements in ascending order, if the set only contains all the elems as integer/float at once.
----------------


1. Set will only print the unique values dropping the duplicates.
2. Set will display the values in an ascending order if all the elems in the set-variable contains the same data (integer, float).
3. Set will display the elems in random order if that set contain string elems. And everytime it'll start randomizing the elems of that set.
4. Set will not display the elems properly in ascending order if the elems contain both the integer & float values together.
5. Set will not display the elems in alphabetically sorted order if the set contains of strings/characters.
6. The set-elems will remove the least value from the set-elems using the 'pop()' func, only if the set only contains integer/float.
    That means, the 'pop()' func will remove the first elem of the set.
-- Adding New Elem --
7. ['Char'/'String' type set]: The 'add()' func will add any 'char'/'string' value randomly inside the set variable.
8. ['Integer/Float' - Unordered]: It the integer/float value-elems exist (which can be sort sequentially by the characteristics of set) in the set-variable then the new elem will be appended at the end of the set.
    But if there is any value missing in the range, then the new value will be appended at the place of missing value.
9. ['Integer/Float' - Ordered]: If the elems in the set-variable is pre-arranged sequentially. Then the new elem will be appended at the end regardless of any missing element in the sequence of the range.
10. [Mix datatype set]: The new element will be added in any random position of the set variable everytime.
